## Shameless promotion :-p
Looking to **kick-start your website** (static page + a CMS) ? Take a look at [play-with-ghost](http://play-with-ghost.com/) (another project I shared). It allows you to see and edit websites made with **Ghost**. In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign up! Just use the dummy email & password provided.

## Wanna help?
If you have solid skills ðŸ¤“ with Docker Swarm, Linux bash and the gang and youâ€™re looking to help a startup to launch a solid project, I would love to get to know you. Buzz me ðŸ‘‹ on Twitter [@askpascalandy](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy). You can see the things that are done and the things we have to do [here](http://firepress.org/blog/technical-challenges-we-are-facing-now/).

Iâ€™m looking for bright and caring people to join this [journey](http://firepress.org/blog/tag/from-the-heart/) with me.
